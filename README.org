#+title: Simple Gallery Maker


Create a very basic image gallery from images in subdirectories.

Each subdirectory name will be used to create a section (a separate
.html file) with the same name.

For example, if there's a subdirectory named ~illustrations~, a new
~illustrations.html~ file will be created and the images in that directory
will be displayed in alphabetical order.
